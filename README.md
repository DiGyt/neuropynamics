# Neuropynamics

In this toolbox we provide examples of various topics that have been introduced in the Neurodynamics lecture by Prof. Gordon Pipa at the University of Osnabrück. 

Each topic is presented as a Jupyter Notebook that should be run within Google Colaboratory. Thus, no pulling or installation of this repository is needed. To get started, check the description of the available topics below and click the links to open the corresponding notebooks. 

## Available notebooks

### Single neurons

We suggest you start your journey with this notebook as it introduces you to the brian2 toolbox that will be used throughout our examples. 
In this notebook you can interactively examine the spiking and reset behavior of different types of single neurons. We will show the equations for the underlying dynamical systems for the neuron models and implement them using brian2.
